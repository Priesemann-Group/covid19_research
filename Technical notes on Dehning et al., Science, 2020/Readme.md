# Model-based and model-free characterization of epidemic outbreaks --- Technical notes on Dehning et al., Science, 2020


This folder and its subfolders hold the scripts which were used to create most of the figures used in the technical note.

The are sorted by the name of the section in the notes.

All (or most?) of these scripts use our
[COVID-19 toolbox](https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference/). In the time of writing these scripts the most recent/stable version was [v0.1.8](https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference/tree/v0.1.8). There is no certainty that any of the scripts will work on another version!
