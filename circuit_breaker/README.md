# Code repository for Long-term stable control of COVID-19 at low casenumbers

In this repository you can find the supplementary code
for our paper on [insert puplication site/magazin].

You can find the C++ code for our model implementation in the 'Cpp_Implementation' folder, the matlab Implementation in the 'Matlab_Implementation' folder and some scripts for plotting especially for the global overview figures in the 'Plotting' folder.

Additionally there is an interactive simulation website where different scenarios are presented which is built upon the here presented C++ code.
